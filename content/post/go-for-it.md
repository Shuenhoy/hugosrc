So far,we have finished all the junior high school English lessons.And it's not far to graduate(Though there is also a term left).

Of all the textbooks of out subjects,I think the English one is the best.Compared with Chinese,Maths, Chemistry and any other subjects.The English Textbooks is quiet different.Firstly,it has a name "Go for it",it seems that it's not just a textbooks but much more.

For the first time I saw it, I thought it was too mess for me to learn anything form it.In fact,so it is.It divide a Unit into Section A,Section B and Reading.And they are also divided into 1A,1B,3C and so on.You can't find the texts from these strange parts.So it's bad for getting the knowledage which is tested.Not only i,but also the teachers think so.They don't use the textbooks very often.In fact,they just let us translate 3A and Reading of each Section.

But,it's not what the editors wanted.The last Unit of the books tells us what it wants to say,"Go for it".It talks about the attitudes, the moods, the dream.It's also that the full textsbook "Go for it" want to tell us.Try yours best to do.By the way,we can say there is the culture in it not only the knowledage.

Thanks the editor who gived us such a good teaching material,and heat the education which wastes it.
