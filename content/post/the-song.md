We once lived on the land that filled with light,
曾住在充满光明的土地

Where is far from the world we haven't understood.
远在令人费解世界之边

We who are children dreamt of sprite and knight,
幻想精灵骑士因是孩提

Which disappeared soon then turuned into teenhood.
转瞬即逝成为懵懂少年

That we found ourselves alone in crowds,
突然发现于人群中倍加孤独

Unknown of what they say and enjoy at all.
全然不知人之所言所喜之事

Don't know what to do to benefit them like clouds,
亦未闻取悦其人并视云之浮

And then separated from them by the wall.
然而则由无形巨墙与其分离

Yet no one to tell about what I have thought,
虽然无人可与其论道谈心

Never had a sense of changing what I am.
从无改变自我之杂念杂思

Been told about immature puzzled me that sought,
曾困扰未成熟之言而后探索其因

Growing happened on myself rather than cram.
成长取决于我而非向任何人作秀

Thus I am lonely but in good company,
因此孤独却亦感陪伴之暖

I am kept company by myself and thee.
陪伴自我并有那你之相伴
